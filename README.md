# ScammEd: the not so real editor.

This is useful when making videos and you want to display some code on screen
but you don't want to type it out (because editing typos is annoying).

Add `//[WAIT]` in your code to pause the printer.

E.g

```rust
//[WAIT]
fn main() {
//[WAIT]
    println!("hello, world");
//[WAIT]
    println!("hello, again");
}
```
